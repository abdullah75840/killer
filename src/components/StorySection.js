        <h1>THE STORY</h1>
        <p>
          Cerise is a woman of many faces. Yet by spy networks and online
          sleuths, she is known only as the Killer GF assassin— the uncatchable
          killer who has no true face. The secret to her success lies in one
          supernatural gift. Wielding the Mirror of Narcissus, she holds at her
          fingertips the ability to reform her appearance into any disguises and
          powers using this dark artifact. This mirror, which consumes both the
          life essences and appearance of her kills, was a gift from the Crimson
          God himself. A heirloom of sorts for his favorite dearly beloved
          killer to better serve him by carrying out the critical assassinations
          that bring down societies, religions, and supernatural entities. Gods,
          even with their gifts, can be cruel with jests that transcend across
          the multiverse…
        </p>
        <p>
          Knowing little of the trick inlaid within the Mirror, Cerise used it
          once more. But this one, being the 7,777th time triggered a breakage
          of dimensions within the mirror, pulling forth 7,777 versions of
          Cerise herself out into the same dimension, wearing what appears to be
          every disguise she has ever worn in the past for her kills.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that is a lot of deadly assassins in one room. But get this, each
          being sentient and believing that she is the real Cerise, they agree
          the only way to determine the one true Cerise would be to participate
          in a game. A deadly set of challenges within the metaverse where by
          playing and winning hearts, the Cerises compete against each other
          using daring and cunning tactics with only one coming out of it alive
          by the end. They say the biggest enemy standing in your way is
          yourself, but did they mean all 7,777?
